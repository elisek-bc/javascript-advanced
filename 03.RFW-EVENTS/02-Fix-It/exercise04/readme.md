* Spoiler alert: in the game 'padi-pado' you can only say words without 'i' or 'o'
  * All letters 'i' and 'o' won't be displayed in the textarea
* Complete the eventHandler 'handleInputTextarea'
  * this checks if the character is permitted or not
  * in case it's not, you stop the standard execution of the event
* Does this also work if you listen to the 'input' event instead of the 'keypress' event? Why (not)?
